Our manuscript **“Optimal Transport with Constraints: From Mirror Descent to Classical Mechanics”** has been accepted for publication in **_Physical Review Letters_**.

This work introduces a constrained OT framework that links mirror‑descent updates to Hamiltonian dynamics, opening new avenues for efficient routing algorithms.  
Pre‑print, code and supplementary materials are available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04727).
