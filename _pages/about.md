I am a computer scientist and applied mathematician whose research explores optimal‑transport theory, machine learning, network science and sustainable mobility. I completed a CS PhD from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and University of Tübingen.

I have taught coursework in mathematics, statistics and machine learning at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My teaching philosophy centres on hands‑on problem solving and mentoring. Beyond the classroom, I also volunteer to the scholarly community as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Open Research Software (JORS) and as a regular reviewer for some applied‑science journals. I also helps organise workshops sessions, supporting open, rigorous and collaborative science.
